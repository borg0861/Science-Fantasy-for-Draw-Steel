# New Terms

We have implemented a few new terms to help make *Draw Steel* feel more like science fantasy.

## Magic → Tech

Clarke’s third law states that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” None of our classes use the term magic. Instead, we’ve replaced that term with Tech. It represents the same idea, but fits our desired theme a bit better. If you want to translate our classes to work with the defaults in Draw Steel (or vice versa) just do a find-and-replace.

## Psionic → Gravitic

“What’s the difference between psionics and gravitics?” you ask.

There isn’t one. We just wanted to make up our own quasi-scientific term for abilities that allow people to do crazy stuff like telepathy and telekinesis. If you want to translate our classes to work with the defaults in Draw Steel (or vice versa) just do a find-and-replace.

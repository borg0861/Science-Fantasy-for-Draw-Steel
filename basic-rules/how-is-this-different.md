# How is This Different

In brief, we are invoking science-fantasy.

In most science fantasy, combat swaps the primacy of melee and ranged combat. Instead of ranged weapons being a backup until the heroes charge in with melee, there is a lot more emphasis on gunplay. These are also settings in which the medieval fantasy skills and talents don’t really fit. Technology, psionics, or some other quasi-scientific words often take the place of magic. While that shouldn’t change most of the rules, there are just a few things we wanted to adjust or bring in to tailor the system to help evoke the feeling of the settings which inspired us.
Mostly, it’s the same. Unless we specifically mention that something is different here, run the game exactly as you would any other game of Draw Steel.

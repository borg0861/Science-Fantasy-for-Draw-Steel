# New and Updated Classes

We plan to add several new kits as additional options to those provided in *Draw Steel*. We will update this listing with a listing of classes and a summary of their core fantasies as they are developed.

## Classes Without Kits

In Science Fantasy for Draw Steel we assume that all characters are capable of using Light Ranged Weapons (such as pistols and submachine guns), and wearing armor. These classes still do not gain access to any of the bonuses or Signature Actions granted by kits unless they obtain access to a kit.

Any abilities, enhancements, or features that grant access to light weapons and light armor, for equipment or treasures, instead allows characters to use medium weapons or armor respectively.
